title: "Electrical grid percolation analysis"
excerpt: "We construct a flow graph approximating Massachusetts' electrical grid. We attempt to compute a percolation probability, using similated random failures, and find that the network as constructed does exhibit criticality. We conclude by highlighting the infrastructure most susceptible to targeted disruption. ![](./images/cover_plot.svg)"
