# About me
I'm a physicist-turned-data-scientist living in the Greater Boston area. My specialties include simulation, modeling, and machine learning. My past work includes simulations of water vapor in turbulent atmosphere, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of barrier crossing problems, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of proteins.

My passion is for adversarial systems, including (but not limited to) cryptosystems, game design, GANs, and game-theoretic frameworks. Did you know that there is a [game-theoretical framework for probability theory](http://www.probabilityandfinance.com/)?

I am also a big believer in online privacy and anonymity, and in exercising security best practices always, against threats both real and imagined. As the name of my site implies, I think there is no such thing as *too paranoid* when it comes to designing secure systems or living a secure and private life.
